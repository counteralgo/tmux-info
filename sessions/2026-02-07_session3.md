# Session Brief — 2026-02-07 (Session 3)

## Completed

### Tailscale SSH — njwilkes_gmail_com on vm1-orch
- Granted full passwordless sudo to `njwilkes_gmail_com` via `/etc/sudoers.d/njwilkes_gmail_com`
- Tailscale SSH works for both `mobile_admin` and `njwilkes_gmail_com` (ACL `autogroup:nonroot` covers all non-root users)
- Added `mobile_admin` to `njwilkes_gmail_com` group and `docker` group on vm1-orch

### Mosh Setup
- Mosh installed and working on both VMs (vm4-seed 1.4.0, vm1-orch 1.3.2)
- UDP ports 60000-61000 open on both VMs
- Added Mosh instructions to `termius-setup.md`
- Tested from Termius — working

### vm4-seed Locale Fix
- Generated `en_US.UTF-8` locale (was missing, causing Termius "cannot set LC_CTYPE" error)
- Set as default locale via `update-locale`
